\title{Allocate statistical weights to each row.}
\usage{
mk_wts(dat, wttype, catch = NULL, sp = NULL, cell_areas = NA)
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{Input dataset}

\item{wttype}{Type of statistical weighting method; 'equal' gives equal weight to all rows, 'area' weights rows in inverse proportion to the number of rows per stratum; 'catch' weights rows in proportion to the catch in the stratum divided by the number of rows in the stratum; cell_area weights rows in proportion to the ocean area of the stratum divided by the number of rows in the stratum}

\item{catch}{An optional vector of catch per stratum.}

\item{sp}{The species to be used for catch weighting.}

\item{cell_areas}{An object containing the areas of all cells.}
}
\value{
A vector indicating the statistical weight to apply to the stratum of which the row is a member.
}
\description{
The function returns a vector indicating a statistical weight to apply to the row, based on the stratum of which the row is a member.
