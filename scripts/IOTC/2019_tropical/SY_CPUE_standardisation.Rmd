Catch, effort and size data for both Seychelles and foreign longliners operating within the Seychelles Exclusive Economic Zone through fishing agreements are managed by the Seychelles Fishing Authority with the software FINNS (Fisheries INtegrated Statistical System) developed by the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission. The software is composed of a database engine based on Microsoft SQL Server to store and validate the data, a central management console for administrative services (e.g. data-access security levels) and some plug-in modules for data entry or editing for instance (IOTC 2005).

Catch-effort data presented here cover the period `r paste(min(catch_effort_dataset_raw$LogYear,na.rm=T),max(catch_effort_dataset_raw$LogYear,na.rm=T),sep='-')` as the data for 2018 are still very partial. Fisheries logbooks are sent to SFA through emails on a monthly basis. The level of logbook return increased from about 20% during 2000-2001 to more than 70% after 2003, exceeding 95% in most years. The geographic position for most operations was checked against VMS data which have been available since the early 2000s. The effort is expressed in number of hooks deployed. Unreported hooks in the logbooks were estimated from the average number of hooks deployed by the vessel in the same month or for the whole year. Information on the number of hooks between floats has become available since 2009. The raw catch-effort data set includes a total of `r prettyNum(nrow(catch_effort_dataset_raw1),big.mark=',')` fishing operations reported from `r length(unique(catch_effort_dataset_raw1$vessid))` different longliners. The number of species to be recorded in longliners' logbooks increased over time and currently includes a minimum of 10 primary species and 13 other species (Annex II of Res. 15/01). The list of species available in the Seychelles logbooks is provided in table \ref{lab::table::species}.

### Remove species with less than number_caught_min fish caught throughout the time period

catch_effort_dataset1 <- catch_effort_dataset_raw1[,!(names(catch_effort_dataset_raw1) %in% species_to_remove)]

### Remove vessels less than number_operations_min of fishing operations throughout the time period

hbf_max <- 31
catch_effort_dataset2[!is.na(catch_effort_dataset2$hbf) & catch_effort_dataset2$hbf> hbf_max,'hbf'] <- NA

### Add some fields to the data set: lunar illumination (moon), 5Â° long and lat, total catch (Total), and tuna catch (Total2), year of fishing trip, unique trip identifier
prepdat <- dataprep_SY(catch_effort_dataset2, region = "IO", splist = c("alb","bet","blm","bsh","bum","bxq","mak","mls","mzz","oil","rsk","sbf","sfa","skh","swo","yft"))

### Add assessment areas ----
dat <- setup_IO_regions(prepdat, regY=TRUE, regY1=FALSE, regY2=TRUE, regY3=TRUE, regB=TRUE, regB1=TRUE, regB2=TRUE, regB3=TRUE, regB4=TRUE, regA=FALSE, regA1=FALSE, regA2=FALSE, regA3=FALSE, regA4=FALSE, regA5=FALSE)

### Save the data
save(dat,file="./data/SYdat.RData")
```

The catch effort data set was filtered:

1. By removing the `r length(species_to_remove)` species from the data set for which the total number of fish caught throughout the period was less than `r prettyNum(number_caught_min,big.mark=',')` fish, i.e. `r paste0(toupper(species_to_remove),collapse = ', ')`;

2. By removing the `r length(vessels_to_remove)` vessels that conducted less than `r number_operations_min` fishing operations throughout the period. This resulted in the removal of a total of `r prettyNum(nrow(catch_effort_dataset1) - nrow(catch_effort_dataset2),big.mark=',')` records from the data set;

3. By replacing by NA all values of number of hooks between floats larger than a threshold of `r hbf_max` considered to represent a maximum value used by the Seychelles longline fleet.

The final data set included `r prettyNum(nrow(dat),big.mark=',')` records of fishing operations made by `r length(unique(dat$vessid))` longliners during `r paste(min(dat$op_yr),max(dat$op_yr),sep='-')`.
